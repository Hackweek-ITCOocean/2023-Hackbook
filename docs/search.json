A repository is a collection of various files that you are tracking for changes and versions. Currently GitHub is the most popular platform for file sharing code and code packages.\nThis section is a step-by-step guide to set up git on our 2i2c JupyterHub. We will also configure git to use your github.com account for managing your repositories hosted on github.com. There are 5 main steps.\n\n\nStep 1: Create a GitHub account\nTo complete the setup, you will need an account on github.com. If you don’t have an account, please visit github.com, create an account (free) and come back to this guide for setting up git.\n\n\nStep 2: Clone a repository\nWe have created a demo repository for you to clone:\nhttps://github.com/Hackweek-ITCOocean/Git-Lesson\n\nStart your 2i2c JupyterHub\nClick on the Git icon\n\n\n\nClick “Clone a Repository”\nWhere is says “Enter the URI of the remote Git repository”, paste in the URL https://github.com/Hackweek-ITCOocean/Git-Lesson\nThe folder appears and you can enter the folder and edit and create files.\n\n\nYour task: Create a file with your name and save to the Git-Lesson folder"

Remember `git` is a program that keeps track of your changes locally (on 2i2c JupyterHub or your own computer) and github.com is a platform to host your repositories. However, since your changes are tracked by `git`, the email/name used in git configuration will show up next to your contributions on github.com when you `push` your repository to github.com (`git push` is discussed in a later step).\n\nConfigure git to store your github credentials to avoid having to enter your github username and token each time you push changes to your repository(in Step 5, we will describe how to use github token instead of a password)\ngit config --global credential.helper store\nCopy link for the demo repository from your github account. Click the green “Code” button and copy the link as shown.\n\nClone the repository using git clone command in the terminal\nTo clone a repository from github, copy the link for the repository (previous step) and use git clone:\ngit clone https://github.com/YOUR-GITHUB-USERNAME/check_github_setup\nNote: Replace YOUR-GITHUB-USERNAME here with your github.com username. For example, it is virdi for my github.com account as seen in this image.\n\nUse ls (list files) to verify the existence of the repository that you just cloned\n\nChange directory to the cloned repository using cd check_github_setup and check the current directory using pwd command (present working directory)\n\nCheck status of your git repository to confirm git set up using git status\n\nYou are all set with using git on your 2i2c JupyterHub! But the collaborative power of git through github needs some additional setup.\nIn the next step, we will create a new file in this repository, track changes to this file, and link it with your github.com account.\n\n\nStep 4. Creating new file and tracking changes\n\nIn the left panel on your 2i2c JupyterHub, click on the “directory” icon and then double click on “check_github_setup” directory.\n\n\nOnce you are in the check_github_setup directory, create a new file using the text editor in your 2i2c JupyterHub (File &gt;&gt; New &gt;&gt; Text File).\n\nName the file lastname.txt. For example, virdi.txt for me (use your last name). Add some content to this file (for example, I added this to my virdi.txt file: my last name is virdi).\n\nNow you should have a new file (lastname.txt) in the git repository directory check_github_setup\nCheck if git can see that you have added a new file using git status. Git reports that you have a new file that is not tracked by git yet, and suggests adding that file to the git tracking system.\n\nAs seen in this image, git suggests adding that file so it can be tracked for changes. You can add file to git for tracking changes using git add. Then, you can commit changes to this file’s content using git commit as shown in the image.\ngit add virdi.txt\ngit status\ngit commit -m \"adding a new file\"\ngit status\n\nAs seen in the image above, git is suggesting to push the change that you just committed to the remote server at github.com (so that your collaborators can also see what changes you made).\nNote: DO NOT execute push yet. Before we push to github.com, let’s configure git further and store our github.com credentials to avoid entering the credentials every time we invoke git push. For doing so, we need to create a token on github.com to be used in place of your github.com password.\n\n\n\nStep 5. Create access token on github.com\n\nGo to your github account and create a new “personal access token”: https://github.com/settings/tokens/new\n\n\n\nGenerate Personal Access Token on github.com\n\n\nEnter a description in “Note” field as seen above, select “repo” checkbox, and scroll to the bottom and click the green button “Generate Token”. Once generated, copy the token (or save it in a text file for reference).\nIMPORTANT: You will see this token only once, so be sure to copy this. If you do not copy your token at this stage, you will need to generate a new token.\n\nTo push (transfer) your changes to github, use git push in terminal. It requires you to enter your github credentials. You will be prompted to enter your github username and “password”. When prompted for your “password”, DO NOT use your github password, use the github token that was copied in the previous step.\ngit push\n\nNote: When you paste your token in the terminal window, windows users will press Ctrl+V and mac os users will press Cmd+V. If it does not work, try generating another token and use the copy icon next to the token to copy the token.

A repository is a collection of various files that you are tracking for changes and versions. Currently GitHub is the most popular platform for file sharing code and code packages.\nThis section is a step-by-step guide to set up git on our 2i2c JupyterHub. We will also configure git to use your github.com account for managing your repositories hosted on github.com. There are 5 main steps.\n\n\nStep 1: Create a GitHub account\nTo complete the setup, you will need an account on github.com. If you don’t have an account, please visit github.com, create an account (free) and come back to this guide for setting up git.\n\n\nStep 2: Clone a repository\nWe have created a demo repository for you to clone:\nhttps://github.com/Hackweek-ITCOocean/Git-Lesson\n\nStart your 2i2c JupyterHub\nClick on the Git icon\n\n\n\nClick “Clone a Repository”\nWhere is says “Enter the URI of the remote Git repository”, paste in the URL https://github.com/Hackweek-ITCOocean/Git-Lesson\nThe folder appears and you can enter the folder and edit and create files.\n\n\nYour task: Create a file with your name and save to the Git-Lesson folder"

Remember `git` is a program that keeps track of your changes locally (on 2i2c JupyterHub or your own computer) and github.com is a platform to host your repositories. However, since your changes are tracked by `git`, the email/name used in git configuration will show up next to your contributions on github.com when you `push` your repository to github.com (`git push` is discussed in a later step).\n\nConfigure git to store your github credentials to avoid having to enter your github username and token each time you push changes to your repository(in Step 5, we will describe how to use github token instead of a password)\ngit config --global credential.helper store\nCopy link for the demo repository from your github account. Click the green “Code” button and copy the link as shown.\n\nClone the repository using git clone command in the terminal\nTo clone a repository from github, copy the link for the repository (previous step) and use git clone:\ngit clone https://github.com/YOUR-GITHUB-USERNAME/check_github_setup\nNote: Replace YOUR-GITHUB-USERNAME here with your github.com username. For example, it is virdi for my github.com account as seen in this image.\n\nUse ls (list files) to verify the existence of the repository that you just cloned\n\nChange directory to the cloned repository using cd check_github_setup and check the current directory using pwd command (present working directory)\n\nCheck status of your git repository to confirm git set up using git status\n\nYou are all set with using git on your 2i2c JupyterHub! But the collaborative power of git through github needs some additional setup.\nIn the next step, we will create a new file in this repository, track changes to this file, and link it with your github.com account.\n\n\nStep 4. Creating new file and tracking changes\n\nIn the left panel on your 2i2c JupyterHub, click on the “directory” icon and then double click on “check_github_setup” directory.\n\n\nOnce you are in the check_github_setup directory, create a new file using the text editor in your 2i2c JupyterHub (File &gt;&gt; New &gt;&gt; Text File).\n\nName the file lastname.txt. For example, virdi.txt for me (use your last name). Add some content to this file (for example, I added this to my virdi.txt file: my last name is virdi).\n\nNow you should have a new file (lastname.txt) in the git repository directory check_github_setup\nCheck if git can see that you have added a new file using git status. Git reports that you have a new file that is not tracked by git yet, and suggests adding that file to the git tracking system.\n\nAs seen in this image, git suggests adding that file so it can be tracked for changes. You can add file to git for tracking changes using git add. Then, you can commit changes to this file’s content using git commit as shown in the image.\ngit add virdi.txt\ngit status\ngit commit -m \"adding a new file\"\ngit status\n\nAs seen in the image above, git is suggesting to push the change that you just committed to the remote server at github.com (so that your collaborators can also see what changes you made).\nNote: DO NOT execute push yet. Before we push to github.com, let’s configure git further and store our github.com credentials to avoid entering the credentials every time we invoke git push. For doing so, we need to create a token on github.com to be used in place of your github.com password.\n\n\n\nStep 5. Create access token on github.com\n\nGo to your github account and create a new “personal access token”: https://github.com/settings/tokens/new\n\n\n\nGenerate Personal Access Token on github.com\n\n\nEnter a description in “Note” field as seen above, select “repo” checkbox, and scroll to the bottom and click the green button “Generate Token”. Once generated, copy the token (or save it in a text file for reference).\nIMPORTANT: You will see this token only once, so be sure to copy this. If you do not copy your token at this stage, you will need to generate a new token.\n\nTo push (transfer) your changes to github, use git push in terminal. It requires you to enter your github credentials. You will be prompted to enter your github username and “password”. When prompted for your “password”, DO NOT use your github password, use the github token that was copied in the previous step.\ngit push\n\nNote: When you paste your token in the terminal window, windows users will press Ctrl+V and mac os users will press Cmd+V. If it does not work, try generating another token and use the copy icon next to the token to copy the token. Then, paste using your computer’s keyboard shortcut for paste.\nNow your password is stored in ~/.git-credentials and you will not be prompted again unless the Github token expires. You can check the presence of this git-credentials file using Terminal. Here the ~ character represents your home directory (/home/jovyan/).\nls -la ~\nThe output looks like this:\ndrwxr-xr-x 13 jovyan jovyan 6144 Oct 22 17:35 .\ndrwxr-xr-x  1 root   root   4096 Oct  4 16:21 ..\n-rw-------  1 jovyan jovyan 1754 Oct 29 18:30 .bash_history\ndrwxr-xr-x  4 jovyan jovyan 6144 Oct 29 16:38 .config\n-rw-------  1 jovyan jovyan   66 Oct 22 17:35 .git-credentials\n-rw-r--r--  1 jovyan jovyan   84 Oct 22 17:14 .gitconfig\ndrwxr-xr-x 10 jovyan jovyan 6144 Oct 21 16:19 2021-Cloud-Hackathon\nYou can also verify your git configuration\n(notebook) jovyan@jupyter-virdi:~$ git config -l\nThe output should have credential.helper = store:\nuser.email        = Makhan.Virdi@gmail.com\nuser.name         = Makhan Virdi\ncredential.helper = store\n\nNow we are all set to collaborate with github on the JupyterHub during the Cloud Hackathon!\n\n\nSummary: Git Commands\n\nCommonly used git commands (modified from source)\n\n\nGit Command\nDescription\n\n\n\n\ngit status\nShows the current state of the repository: the current working branch, files in the staging area, etc.\n\n\ngit add\nAdds a new, previously untracked file to version control and marks already tracked files to be committed with the next commit\n\n\ngit commit\nSaves the current state of the repository and creates an entry in the log\n\n\ngit log\nShows the history for the repository\n\n\ngit diff\nShows content differences between commits, branches, individual files and more\n\n\ngit clone\nCopies a repository to your local environment, including all the history\n\n\ngit pull\nGets the latest changes of a previously cloned repository\n\n\ngit push\nPushes your local changes to the remote repository, sharing them with others\n\n\n\n\n\nGit: More Details\nLesson: For a more detailed self-paced lesson on git, visit Git Lesson from Software Carpentry\nCheatsheet: Frequently used git commands\nDangit, Git!?!: If you are stuck after a git mishap, there are ready-made solutions to common problems at Dangit, Git!?!\n\n\nCloning our repository using the git Jupyter lab extension.\nIf we’re already familiar with git commands and feel more confortable using a GUI our Jupyterhub deployment comes with a git extension.

    "section": "Introduction :: Version Control (Git and Github)",
    "text": "Introduction :: Version Control (Git and Github)\n\nWhat is version control, git, github, and how to set it up?\nVersion control is managing and tracking changes to your documents (program source code, images, websites, data files, etc.). git is a popular tool used for version control of software code. github.com is popular platform that provides remote server hosting for git repositories. A repository is a collection of various files that you are tracking for changes and versions (think of it as a directory with files that are being tracked for changes, using git for taking snapshots of versions as you are developing).\nThis section is a step-by-step guide to set up git on your 2i2c JupyterHub instance (referred to as 2i2c JupyterHub in these instruction). We will also configure git to use your github.com account for managing your repositories hosted on github.com. There are 5 main steps with substeps, includes instruction for addressing github’s new approach for token authentication.\n\n\nStep 1: Create a github account\nTo complete the setup, you will need an account on github.com. If you don’t have an account, please visit github.com, create an account (free) and come back to this guide for setting up git.\n\n\nStep 2: Fork a repository\nA fork is a copy of a repository from another github account (for example NASA-Openscapes account) to your github account (for example, my account virdi) that then you have permission to edit. To help you finish this setup correctly, we have created a demo repository on Openscapes github account named check_github_setup. You can fork this repository into your github account following these steps:\n\nLog in to your github.com account\nGo to the demo repository at NASA-Openscapes github\n\nClick on the fork icon in the top right corner, as shown in the image below and click your user name if prompted to do so\n\n\n\n\nStep 3: Clone the repository that you just forked\nNow you have a fork of the demo repository in your github account that we can clone it in your 2i2c instance. In the code below, commands beginning with git is a git command for version control and synching; commands that don’t start with git are bash/linux/command line commands.\n\nStart your 2i2c JupyterHub and open a terminal\nFile &gt;&gt; New &gt;&gt; Terminal\nMake sure you are in your home directory by usingpwd command and verifying the output as below\n/home/jovyan\n\nConfigure git with your name and email address.\ngit config --global user.name \"Makhan Virdi\"\ngit config --global user.email \"Makhan.Virdi@gmail.com\"\nNote: This name and email could be different from your github.com credentials. Remember git is a program that keeps track of your changes locally (on 2i2c JupyterHub or your own computer) and github.com is a platform to host your repositories. However, since your changes are tracked by git, the email/name used in git configuration will show up next to your contributions on github.com when you push your repository to github.com (git push is discussed in a later step).\nConfigure git to store your github credentials to avoid having to enter your github username and token each time you push changes to your repository(in Step 5, we will describe how to use github token instead of a password)\ngit config --global credential.helper store\nCopy link for the demo repository from your github account. Click the green “Code” button and copy the link as shown.\n\nClone the repository using git clone command in the terminal\nTo clone a repository from github, copy the link for the repository (previous step) and use git clone:\ngit clone https://github.com/YOUR-GITHUB-USERNAME/check_github_setup\nNote: Replace YOUR-GITHUB-USERNAME here with your github.com username. For example, it is virdi for my github.com account as seen in this image.\n\nUse ls (list files) to verify the existence of the repository that you just cloned\n\nChange directory to the cloned repository using cd check_github_setup and check the current directory using pwd command (present working directory)\n\nCheck status of your git repository to confirm git set up using git status\n\nYou are all set with using git on your 2i2c JupyterHub! But the collaborative power of git through github needs some additional setup.\nIn the next step, we will create a new file in this repository, track changes to this file, and link it with your github.com account.\n\n\n\nStep 4. Creating new file and tracking changes\n\nIn the left panel on your 2i2c JupyterHub, click on the “directory” icon and then double click on “check_github_setup” directory.\n\n\nOnce you are in the check_github_setup directory, create a new file using the text editor in your 2i2c JupyterHub (File &gt;&gt; New &gt;&gt; Text File).\n\nName the file lastname.txt. For example, virdi.txt for me (use your last name). Add some content to this file (for example, I added this to my virdi.txt file: my last name is virdi).\n\nNow you should have a new file (lastname.txt) in the git repository directory check_github_setup\nCheck if git can see that you have added a new file using git status. Git reports that you have a new file that is not tracked by git yet, and suggests adding that file to the git tracking system.\n\nAs seen in this image, git suggests adding that file so it can be tracked for changes. You can add file to git for tracking changes using git add. Then, you can commit changes to this file’s content using git commit as shown in the image.\ngit add virdi.txt\ngit status\ngit commit -m \"adding a new file\"\ngit status\n\nAs seen in the image above, git is suggesting to push the change that you just committed to the remote server at github.com (so that your collaborators can also see what changes you made).\nNote: DO NOT execute push yet. Before we push to github.com, let’s configure git further and store our github.com credentials to avoid entering the credentials every time we invoke git push. For doing so, we need to create a token on github.com to be used in place of your github.com password.\n\n\n\nStep 5. Create access token on github.com\n\nGo to your github account and create a new “personal access token”: https://github.com/settings/tokens/new\n\n\n\nGenerate Personal Access Token on github.com\n\n\nEnter a description in “Note” field as seen above, select “repo” checkbox, and scroll to the bottom and click the green button “Generate Token”. Once generated, copy the token (or save it in a text file for reference).\nIMPORTANT: You will see this token only once, so be sure to copy this. If you do not copy your token at this stage, you will need to generate a new token.\n\nTo push (transfer) your changes to github, use git push in terminal. It requires you to enter your github credentials. You will be prompted to enter your github username and “password”. When prompted for your “password”, DO NOT use your github password, use the github token that was copied in the previous step.\ngit push\n\nNote: When you paste your token in the terminal window, windows users will press Ctrl+V and mac os users will press Cmd+V. If it does not work, try generating another token and use the copy icon next to the token to copy the token. Then, paste using your computer’s keyboard shortcut for paste.\nNow your password is stored in ~/.git-credentials and you will not be prompted again unless the Github token expires. You can check the presence of this git-credentials file using Terminal.

    "text": "Step 5. Tracking changes (Optional)\nNow that you have forked and cloned the repository in your Hub, you can make changes (edit, add, and/or delete content) and track these files using git. In this step, we will provide an overview of how to use git using the graphical interface (the JupyterLab git extension).\n\nStep 5.1. Configure Git (git config)\nConfigure git with your name and email address as shown here.\ngit config --global user.name \"Makhan Virdi\"\ngit config --global user.email \"Makhan.Virdi@gmail.com\"\nOpen a new terminal: File &gt;&gt; New &gt;&gt; Terminal\n\nConfigure git to store your github credentials to avoid having to enter your github username and token each time you push changes to your repository(in Step 5.5, we will describe how to use github token instead of a password)\ngit config --global credential.helper store\n\n\nStep 5.2. Create a new file\nLet’s create a new file: In the left panel on your Hub, click on the “directory” icon and then double click on “2021-Cloud-Hackathon” directory. Then, create a new file using the text editor in your 2i2c JupyterHub (File &gt;&gt; New &gt;&gt; Text File). Add some text to this file, for example: A test file. Save this file and rename it to test.txt.\n\n\n\nStep 5.3. Track the changes to the new file (git add)\nClick the git icon in the left panel. You can see that the newly added file is in the “Untracked” section. You can click the + icon next to the file name to let git track this file for changes.\n\n\n\nStep 5.4. Commit the changes to the new file (git commit)\nNow, you will see that the file is Staged, which means that git is ready to take a snapshot of this file (and the repository) with the changes that you made. This snapshot is called a commit. To commit the changes, add a note (called a commit message) by typing in the text box that say “Summary”.\nNow, click the blue “COMMIT” button to commit this change.\n\nNote: A short message indicating the type of change to this file is a good practice. Optionally, a longer description may be added to the “Description” field.\n\n\n\n\nStep 5.5. Transmit committed changes to your github (git push)\nAt this stage, you have committed the changes to your git repository on your Hub. However, these changes are still on your Hub and needs to be transmitted to your repository on github (so that both the local copy on the JupyterHub and the remote copy on github are in sync).\nAs seen in the picture below, the git extension indicates (with an orange dot on the cloud icon) that it is ready to push your changes to the remote (remote = your repository on github.com). To push to github, click the cloud button with an up arrow (circled in red in the picture).\n\nWhen you push for the first time, it will ask that you input your credentials. You will need to set this up with your Personal Access Token (PAT), explained next.\n\n\nStep 5.6. Setup your Personal Access Token (PAT)\nWhen you see the following screenshot, GitHub is asking for you to input your credentials. (Note: you see this screenshot when you have committed work to push to GitHub.com, as detailed above).\n\nThe git extension in the Hub is prompting you to enter your github.com credentials. Enter you github.com username and a Personal Access Token (PAT); DO NOT use your password.\nTo create a PAT, visit https://github.com/settings/tokens/new and create a new token with the permission as per the image below and specify its validity for 90 days.\n\nIMPORTANT: You will see this token only once, so be sure to copy this. If you do not copy your token at this stage, you will need to generate a new token.\n\nOnce you generate the token, copy it and paste in the Hub window that prompted you to enter the “Personal Access Token”.\n\nGit will show a message at the bottom right telling that the changes were “Successfully pushed”. Also, you will see that the “cloud icon with an up arrow” no longer has an orange dot, indicating that there are no more committed changes to push to the remote (github.com).\n\nNote: You have configured git extension to store your credentials. You will not be prompted for your login/token again!\n\n\nThat’s all. You can use the same workflow (add &gt; commit &gt; push) for any other new or modified files!\n\n\nNote: If you are comfortable with the command line, you can use the Terminal (In Hub, New &gt; Terminal) and follow the steps outlined in the Clinic section."

    "text": "Background\nStudy of coastal upwelling dynamics using image machine-learning algorithms applied to remote-sensing data PI: Eli Holmes, Northwest Fisheries Science Center, NOAA Fisheries, Seattle WA\nCoastal upwelling is a key driver of productive fisheries. It is largely driven by coastal winds that produce wind stress perpendicular to the coast. This wind stress pulls surface water away from the coast and pulls deep, cold, nutrient rich water to the surface. Strong and consistent coastal upwelling happens in specific regions around the world and supports strong fisheries in these regions. An interesting and curious aspect of upwelling is that it is influenced by ocean-atmosphere teleconnections—correlations in ocean climate across long-distances. In plain language, it means that a pattern that arises in one part of the world’s oceans will be seen later on the other side of the world in a very different part of the world. One of these teleconnections is between temperature anomalies in the North Atlantic Ocean and coastal upwelling in the Arabian Sea.\n\nIn this project, we are exploring the use of machine learning and image machine learning to study relationships between coastal upwelling and the physical oceanography of the Arabian Sea. The goal is to explore whether these approaches provide a promising way to develop predictive models for upwelling intensity. For the project, we are using Python libraries for implementing neural networks with image inputs, including TensorFlow, PyTorch, and Keras."

To illustrate this template, you can liken it to downloading every variable as an Xarray DataArray, and combine them together based on the coordinates. In the URL above, the order and specifications of the dimension slicing options must be the consistent for all variables, just like how Xarray combining by coords only works if the coordinates are so.\nThe template is also well-explained in GRIDDAP documentation.\nWe can all agree that trying to write down every template for different datasets is error-prone and tedious, so you are more than welcome to copy and modify your template using the original file generator Python formatted strings to help with generating URLs for downloads. Since URLs vary greatly form dataset to dataset, there is no ideal URL template to consider, but we will still develop a function to generalize the URL generator to the best of my knowledge.\nNOTE: for the URL template, we focus on downloading smaller chunks of the dataset, sliced temporally just like downloading from the EarthData database so that the remote server would not be broken handling the request. We also recommend you to download variables together in one NetCDF3 file (multiple variable names in one URL) instead of individual variables as it takes time piecing them all together."

For the example below, we average our wind speed over the whole area and plot it over time. Matplotlib automatically infers what graph to create if you don’t explicitly call which one to. This piece of code below is a demonstration:\n\nds['speed'].mean(dim=['lat', 'lon']).plot(figsize=(10, 5))\n\n\n\n\nWe can add in parameters to customize our graphs, as additional arguments are passed to the underlying matplotlib plot() function.\n\nds['air_temp'].mean(dim=['lat', 'lon']).sel(time=slice('2007', '2009')).plot.line('r-o', figsize=(10,5), markersize=1)\n\n\n\n\n\n# creating a new Axe object if there is no currently\n# available one\nax = plt.gca() \nds['direction'].plot.hist(ax = ax)\nax.set_xlabel('10 metre wind direction (degrees east)')\nax.set_ylabel('frequency')\nax.set_title('Daily average wind direction distribution over covered area (1979-2022)')\n\nText(0.5, 1.0, 'Daily average wind direction distribution over covered area (1979-2022)')\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGraphing with holoviews\nXarray also support graphing using holoviews if you want interactive visualizations.\n\n# scroll along the axes to stretch the graph\nheatmap_arr.hvplot().options(cmap='bgy', width=600, height=500)\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n\n\n\n\n\n# resampling is having issues, so this is a temporary solution using Pandas \n# to perform resampling by month on one range...\n\n# choose a small range just in case overloadding happens...\n\nds_to_resample = ds['CHL'].sel(lat=slice(10, 5), lon=slice(75, 80)).to_dataframe()\n\n\ndf_resampled = ds_to_resample.groupby([pd.Grouper(freq='1M', level='time'),\n                        pd.Grouper(level='lon'),\n                        pd.Grouper(level='lat')]).mean()\n\n\nds_resampled = xr.Dataset.from_dataframe(df_resampled)\n\nWe can see that after resampling, our time dimension size is reduced from 8523 (days) to 280 (months).

    "text": "Contour mapping\nSometimes we want to identify areas in which our data may behave differently. One of the best ways to do this is to create contour maps.\n\nCoastline mapping\nCoastlines can help us separate land and ocean area. We can plot the coastline for our region of interest without using our data.\n\ngeo_axes = plt.axes(projection=cartopy.crs.PlateCarree())\n# add stock image\n# geo_axes.stock_img()\ngeo_axes.set_extent([42, 102, -12, 32])\ngeo_axes.coastlines()\n\n&lt;cartopy.mpl.feature_artist.FeatureArtist at 0x7f075b7164f0&gt;\n\n\n\n\n\nWe can also apply the coastline onto our data. The example below shows a heatmap with the coastline drawn on top of it\n\ntopo = xr.open_dataset('../data/finalized/topography.nc')\n\n\nfig, ax = plt.subplots(subplot_kw=dict(projection=cartopy.crs.PlateCarree()))\ntopo.topo.plot.imshow(ax=ax)\nax.add_feature(cartopy.feature.COASTLINE)\n\n&lt;cartopy.mpl.feature_artist.FeatureArtist at 0x7f17db906580&gt;\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTopography mapping\nWe also have a topography dataset that spans the same grid as our final dataset.

We’ll follow convention by giving the module the shortname xr\n\nimport xarray as xr\nxr.set_options(keep_attrs=True)\n\nI’m going to use one of xarray’s tutorial datasets. In this case, air temperature from the NCEP reanalysis. I’ll assign the result of the open_dataset to ds. I may change this to access a dataset directly\n\nds = xr.tutorial.open_dataset(\"air_temperature\")\n\nAs we are in an interactive environment, we can just type ds to see what we have.\n\nds\n\nFirst thing to notice is that ds is an xarray.Dataset object. It has dimensions, lat, lon, and time. It also has coordinate variables with the same names as these dimensions. These coordinate variables are 1-dimensional. This is a NetCDF convention. The Dataset contains one data variable, air. This has dimensions (time, lat, lon).\nClicking on the document icon reveals attributes for each variable. Clicking on the disk icon reveals a representation of the data.\nEach of the data and coordinate variables can be accessed and examined using the variable name as a key.\n\nds.air\n\n\nds['air']\n\nThese are xarray.DataArray objects. This is the basic building block for xarray.\nVariables can also be accessed as attributes of ds.\n\nds.time\n\nA major difference between accessing a variable as an attribute versus using a key is that the attribute is read-only but the key method can be used to update the variable. For example, if I want to convert the units of air from Kelvin to degrees Celsius.\n\nds['air'] = ds.air - 273.15\n\nThis approach can also be used to add new variables\n\nds['air_kelvin'] = ds.air + 273.15\n\nIt is helpful to update attributes such as units, this saves time, confusion and mistakes, especially when you save the dataset.\n\nds['air'].attrs['units'] = 'degC'\n\n\nds"

    "text": "Subsetting and Indexing\nSubsetting and indexing methods depend on whether you are working with a Dataset or DataArray. A DataArray can be accessed using positional indexing just like a numpy array. To access the temperature field for the first time step, you do the following.\n\nds['air'][0,:,:]\n\nNote this returns a DataArray with coordinates but not attributes.\nHowever, the real power is being able to access variables using coordinate variables. I can get the same subset using the following. (It’s also more explicit about what is being selected and robust in case I modify the DataArray and expect the same output.)\n\nds['air'].sel(time='2013-01-01').time\n\n\nds.air.sel(time='2013-01-01')\n\nI can also do slices. I’ll extract temperatures for the state of Colorado. The bounding box for the state is [-109 E, -102 E, 37 N, 41 N].\nIn the code below, pay attention to both the order of the coordinates and the range of values. The first value of the lat coordinate variable is 41 N, the second value is 37 N. Unfortunately, xarray expects slices of coordinates to be in the same order as the coordinates. Note lon is 0 to 360 not -180 to 180, and I let python calculate it for me within the slice.\n\nds.air.sel(lat=slice(41.,37.), lon=slice(360-109,360-102))\n\nWhat if we want temperature for a point, for example Denver, CO (39.72510678889283 N, -104.98785545855408 E). xarray can handle this! If we just want data from the nearest grid point, we can use sel and specify the method as “nearest”.\n\ndenver_lat, denver_lon = 39.72510678889283, -104.98785545855408\n\n\nds.air.sel(lat=denver_lat, lon=360+denver_lon, method='nearest')\n\nIf we want to interpolate, we can use interp(). In this case I use linear or bilinear interpolation.\ninterp() can also be used to resample data to a new grid and even reproject data\n\nds.air.interp(lat=denver_lat, lon=360+denver_lon, method='linear')\n\nsel() and interp() can also be used on Dataset objects.\n\nds.sel(lat=slice(41.,37.), lon=slice(360-109,360-102))\n\n\nds.interp(lat=denver_lat, lon=360+denver_lon, method='linear')"

I’ll extract temperatures for the state of Colorado.

The first value of the lat coordinate variable is 41 N, the second value is 37 N. Unfortunately, xarray expects slices of coordinates to be in the same order as the coordinates.

    "text": "Summary\nZarr is an open source library for storing N-dimensional array data. It supports multidimensional arrays with attributes and dimensions similar to NetCDF4, and it can be read by XArray. Zarr is often used for data held in cloud object storage (like Amazon S3), because it is better optimized for these situations than NetCDF4.\nDO NOT USE zarr-eodis-store is depends on only XArray\nThe zarr-eosdis-store library allows NASA EOSDIS NetCDF4 files to be read more efficiently by transferring only file metadata and data needed for computation in a small number of requests, rather than moving the whole file or making many small requests. It works by making the files directly readable by the Zarr Python library and XArray across a network. To use it, files must have a corresponding metadata file ending in .dmrpp, which increasingly true for cloud-accessible EOSDIS data. https://github.com/nasa/zarr-eosdis-store\nThe zarr-eosdis-store library provides several benefits over downloading EOSDIS data files and accessing them using XArray, NetCDF4, or HDF5 Python libraries:\n\nIt only downloads the chunks of data you actually read, so if you don’t read all variables or the full spatiotemporal extent of a file, you usually won’t spend time downloading those portions of the file\nIt parallelizes and optimizes downloads for the portions of files you do read, so download speeds can be faster in general\nIt automatically interoperates with Earthdata Login if you have a .netrc file set up\nIt is aware of some EOSDIS cloud implementation quirks and provides caching that can save time for repeated requests to individual files\n\nIt can also be faster than using XArray pointing NetCDF4 files with s3:// URLs, depending on the file’s internal structure, and is often more convenient.\nConsider using this library when: 1. The portion of the data file you need to use is much smaller than the full file, e.g. in cases of spatial subsets or reading a single variable from a file containing several 1. s3:// URLs are not readily available 1. Code need to run outside of the AWS cloud or us-west-2 region or in a hybrid cloud / non-cloud manner 1. s3:// access using XArray seems slower than you would expect (possibly due to unoptimized internal file structure) 1. No readily-available, public, cloud-optimized version of the data exists already. The example we show is also available as an AWS Public Dataset: https://registry.opendata.aws/mur/ 1. Adding “.dmrpp” to the end of a data URL returns a file\n\nObjectives\n\nBuild on prior knowledge from CMR and Earthdata Login tutorials\nWork through an example of using the EOSDIS Zarr Store to access data using XArray\nLearn about the Zarr format and library for accessing data in the cloud"

Up to this point, we haven’t read any data values, only metadata. The next line will force XArray to read the portions of the source files containing our area of interest. Behind the scenes, the eosdis-zarr-store library is ensuring data is fetched as efficiently as possible.\nNote: This line isn’t strictly necessary, since XArray will automatically read the data we need the first time our code tries to use it, but calling this will make sure that we can read the data multiple times later on without re-fetching anything from the source files.\nThis line will take several seconds to complete, but since it is retrieving only about 50 MB of data from 22 GB of source files, several seconds constitutes a significant time, bandwidth, and disk space savings.\n\nsst.load();\n\nNow we can start looking at aggregations across the time dimension. In this case, plot the standard deviation of the temperature at each point to get a visual sense of how much temperatures fluctuate over the course of the month.\n\n# We expect a warning here, from finding the standard deviation of arrays that contain all N/A values.\n# numpy produces N/A for these points, though, which is exactly what we want.\nstdev_sst = sst.std('time')\nstdev_sst.name = 'stdev of analysed_sst [Kelvin]'\nstdev_sst.plot();\n\n/srv/conda/envs/notebook/lib/python3.9/site-packages/numpy/lib/nanfunctions.py:1670: RuntimeWarning: Degrees of freedom &lt;= 0 for slice.\n  var = nanvar(a, axis=axis, dtype=dtype, out=out, ddof=ddof,\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInteractive animation of a month of data\nThis section isn’t as important to fully understand. It shows us a way to get an interactive animation to see what we have retrieved so far\nDefine an animation function to plot the ith time step. We need to make sure each plot is using the same color scale, set by vmin and vmax so the animation is consistent\n\nsst_min = sst.min()\nsst_max = sst.max()\n\ndef show_time_step(i):\n    plt.clf()\n    res = sst[i].plot.imshow(vmin=sst_min, vmax=sst_max)\n    return (res,)\n\nRender each time slice once and show it as an HTML animation with interactive controls\n\n#anim = animation.FuncAnimation(plt.gcf(), func=show_time_step, frames=len(sst))\n#display(HTML(anim.to_jshtml()))\n#plt.close()\n\n\n\n\nSupplemental: What’s happening here?\nFor EOSDIS data in the cloud, we have begun producing a metadata sidecar file in a format called DMR++ that extracts all of the information about arrays, variables, and dimensions from data files, as well as the byte offsets in the NetCDF4 file where data can be found. This information is sufficient to let the Zarr library read data from our NetCDF4 files, but it’s in the wrong format. zarr-eosdis-store knows how to fetch the sidecar file and transform it into something the Zarr library understands. Passing it when reading Zarr using XArray or the Zarr library lets these libraries interact with EOSDIS data exactly as if they were Zarr stores in a way that’s more optimal for reading data in the cloud. Beyond this, the zarr-eosdis-store library makes some optimizations in the way it reads data to help make up for situations where the NetCDF4 file is not internally arranged well for cloud-based access patterns."

It is the same inside a Quarto document, at the console and in scripts.\n\nhere::i_am(\"r-tutorials/03-r-read-in-data.qmd\")\n\nhere() starts at /Users/eli.holmes/Documents/GitHub/2023-Cloudbook\n\nhere::here()\n\n[1] \"/Users/eli.holmes/Documents/GitHub/2023-Cloudbook\"\n\n\nNow to specify a data file, I use\n\nfil &lt;- here::here(\"r-tutorials\", \"data\", \"myfile.csv\")\nfil\n\n[1] \"/Users/eli.holmes/Documents/GitHub/2023-Cloudbook/r-tutorials/data/myfile.csv\"\n\n\nThis fully specifies the file location.\n\n\nDon’t use setwd()\nThis changes your working directory and although it seems to help in the short-run, it causes all kinds of problems later."

This inheriting feature is usually very handy, but when working with multiple data frames, it is often clearer if you keep the data and aes() with the points and lines.\nHere is another example of plotting data from two different data frames:\n\nggplot() +\n  geom_line(data=iris, aes(x = Sepal.Length, y=Petal.Length)) +\n  geom_bar(data=mtcars, aes(x=cyl), alpha=0.3) +\n  ylab(\"y\") + xlab(\"x\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAdding a legend\nggplot makes it rather hard to modify your legend if you create a plot this way. Creating a manual legend, as opposed to dynamically as ggplot is supposed to work, can be quite hard. First thing to know is that the color, linestyle, and/or shape must be in aes() to appear in the legend. If it’s not there you can’t control it in the legend.\nNote: What I am about to show is really hacky and not the way ggplot is intended to be used, but it comes up so often for new ggplot users that I want you to see a solution so you don’t give up on ggplot because of legends. Jump ahead to the correct ggplot workflow with long-form data frames to see how to avoid this.\nThis works. Ignore the warning about unknown aesthetics.\n\nggplot() +\n  geom_point(data=df, aes(x=x, y=val, col=\"df\", linetype=\"df\")) +\n  geom_line(data=df2, aes(x=x, y=val2, col=\"df2\", linetype=\"df2\")) +\n  scale_color_manual(\"name\", values=c(\"blue\", \"black\")) +\n  scale_linetype_manual(\"name\",values=c(0,1))\n\nWarning in geom_point(data = df, aes(x = x, y = val, col = \"df\", linetype =\n\"df\")): Ignoring unknown aesthetics: linetype"

Advice for choosing a GitHub username: this is a professional username that you will use in work/academic communities. GitHub accounts are not anonymous; this is for sharing work. Using your real name is common.\nRemember your username and password; you will need to be logged in during the course!\nHere is a video showing the whole process\n\nEarthdata Login account\n\nCreate an Earthdata Login account (if you don’t already have one) at https://urs.earthdata.nasa.gov\nRemember your username and password; you will need to be logged in during the course!\n\nSlack account\n\nWe will use Slack as our messaging platform during the course. Feel free to use to communicate and coordinate with the fellow course participants.\nThe link to join our Slack workspace was sent on Sept 4th in the course info email.\nReach out to the organizers if you can’t find the email."

JupyterHub and JupyterLab is a standard platform for “big data geoscience” and working on this platform will prepare you for using the tools and notebooks developed by this research community. However we also want you to be able to run R and RStudio on your own computer.\n\nR: https://cran.r-project.org/\n\nInstall the latest version of R that you can for your operating system. Preferably you want version 4.3+ but at the least you need version 4.1.\nIf you have R already installed, update to the newest version (4.3)\n\nRStudio Desktop: https://posit.co/download/rstudio-desktop/\n\nInstall the most recent version you can. Update your version if you have an old version installed."

This way you will be ready to start working with the course scripts and tutorials on day 1. These will only take you a 2-3 hours and will make your course experience much more worthwhile.\nAny of these is sufficient. Note, if you already program in R, you do not need to do this.\n\nW3Schools Basic R\nBasics of R and installing RStudio\nYouTube: R for Beginners\nFor a longer free course, CodeAcademy has a good Intro to R. Note this is 20 hours. You do NOT need to do this whole course before the hackweek!\nIf you know the basics of R but have never done modeling, then you can start with this 2.5 hour course that covers basic linear regression with R and plotting with ggplot2:\nOne of the best free R courses is Coursera’s Learn R. You can see the lectures for free. Make sure to click AUDIT when it asks you to sign up for a 7-day trial. You do not need to sign up for anything to go through the material.\n\n\nGitHub Discussion Board\nWe will use GitHub Discussion boards for communication during the course. If you like, you can install the GitHub app on your phone and get updates when there are announcements."
